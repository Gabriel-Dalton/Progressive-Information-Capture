# Progressive Information Capture

This project demonstrates a Progressive Information Capture form where users begin by entering their email address and are then guided to provide additional details like their full name and password in a step-by-step manner. The email entered initially is pre-filled on the subsequent form to ensure a seamless and user-friendly registration process.

## Features

- **Step 1: Email Input**
  - The initial page presents a clean and simple form with an email input field and a "Get Started" button.

- **Step 2: Additional Information**
  - After submitting the email, the user is redirected to a second page to provide further details like their full name and password. The email is automatically pre-filled to maintain continuity.
